Ssscrape developer's documentation
----------------------------------

To generate documentation from the source code, you need Doxygen installed 
on your system, and enviroment variable DX_HOME set to the root of Doxygen
installation (so that $DX_HOME/bin/doxygen is the Doxygen executable).
You can download Doxygen from http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html


After Doxygen is installed, run "make" in this directory. The documentation
will be generated in the html/ subdirectory. Point your browser to html/index.html
to have a look.
