Almost No Effort Web Toolkit
============================

Anewt is a collection of PHP libraries designed to aid rapid web
development.

The Almost No Effort Web Toolkit helps you quickly create fully
standards-compliant dynamic web sites and web applications. It consists
of a number of modules which help you work with strict XHTML pages, text
formatting, database abstraction and validation, form creation and
handling and other web-related things like session control and
syndication. Anewt is entirely written in PHP (originally developed for
PHP 4, but now targeted at PHP 5).

Note that Anewt is not a web framework. It will provide you with all the
tools without forcing you to organize your project in a specific way. That
means you can use your own preferred directory layout, filenames, etc.

More information can be found inside the doc/ directory. There is a manual
(incomplete) and API documentation (generated from the source code).
