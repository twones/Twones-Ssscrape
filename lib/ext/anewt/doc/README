Documentation
=============

The manual is written by hand as a complete developer's reference.
The API documentation is extracted from the source code.


Manual
======

The manual is a book written for developers. It covers the concepts used
in Anewt, descriptions of the modules and contains lots of examples.

The manual is written in Docbook markup and transformed to XHTML pages
(styled with CSS) using custom XSLT. The XHTML files are automatically
generated and should therefore not be edited. Changes will get lost!

The icons (and also the colorscheme) used in the manual are the ones
from the Tango Desktop Project (http://tango-project.org/). They're not
included with Anewt. Get them yourself en put them in the manual/icons/
directory.

All example code snippets are in seperate files in the examples/
subdirectory. The .php files are highlighted by GeSHi (Generic Syntax
Highlighter, http://qbnz.com/highlighter/). Run "make" in the examples
directory to generate the .xml files from the .php files using the small
highlight script. For this to work you will need to put the GeSHi source
code in the examples/geshi/ directory.


Doxygen
=======

The Doxygen documenation is generated automatically from the source
files. It covers all classes, methods and parameters and is intended as
an API reference for developers.
