h1. Textile test page

p. This file contains a lot of Textile markup, both valid and invalid.


h1. Headers

h2{color:green}. This is a green title

h3. This is a subhead

h4. And another one

h5. Yet another one

h6. Okay, this is the last one


h1. Basic text

p{color:red}. This is some text of dubious character. Isn't the use of "quotes" just lazy writing -- and theft of 'intellectual property' besides? I think the time has come to see a block quote.

bq[nl]. A simple block quote with a language specified.

p(#foo){color:green}.. This is green text with a continuation marker and a id value. The style should be preserved...

...so that this text should be green..

This line does not change anything, so it should be green as well.

p. Back to normal.


h1. Modifiers

h2. Basic modifiers

p. No modifiers

p(class). Class only

p(#simple-id). Id only

p(class#class-and-id). Class and id

p{color:green}. Style only.

p(class){color:green}. Class and style

p(#id-style){color:green}. Id and style

p(class#class-id-style){color:green}. Class, id and style

p(class#class-id-style-lang)[nl_NL]{color:green}. Class, id, style and lang

h2. Alignment modifiers

p<. This paragraph is left-aligned.

p=. This paragraph is centered.

p>. This paragraph is right-aligned.

p{color: red}<>. This paragraph is justified and red.

p(. This paragraph has 1em padding at the left.

p(()). This paragraph has 2em padding at both sides.

p(((. This paragraph has 3em padding at the left.

h2. Malformed modifier parts

p(-) Invalid class name

p(#-) Invalid id.

p(-#-) Invalid class name and invalid id.

h2. Empty modifier parts

p. There are quite a few combination possible with empty modifier parts. None
of the paragraphs below should show have any modifiers applied to them.

p(). Bogus modifier (empty class)

p{}. Bogus modifier (empty style)

p[]. Bogus modifier (empty lang)

p(){}. Bogus modifier (empty class and style)

p(){}. Bogus modifier (empty class and lang)

p[]{}. Bogus modifier (empty style and lang)

p()[]{}. Bogus modifier (empty style, class, and lang)


h1(#inline-markup). Inline markup

This should show some _emphasized text_.

Here is some *strongly emphasized text*.

Some more *strongly emphasized text* as well, *42* is a strong number, and real **bold** is possible as well.

Of course __real italics__ can be used as well.

This strange *invalid **nesting* may not cause errors, and this _*isn't valid either*_

This line *triggered a **bug** _*in some old code but should not be a problem anymore*._

Ok now that we're done with emphasis, lets's use some ~subscripted~ text.

And ^superscript^, of course. a^2^ + b^2^ = c^2^. Q.e.d. A stray superscript marker should just be ignored:^

h1. Complex examples

. This is some tricky text starting with a full stop and a space. The
start of this paragraph should not be mistakenly interpreted as a
modifier block.

h2()[nl]{color:red}>. Right aligned red header in Dutch.


h1. Lists

This should not be a list:

# Looks like an item
# And another one
but this line spoils the fun

Simple unordered list:

* First item
* Second item
* Third item

Ordered list with custom color

#{color:blue} This should be blue
# Item 2
# Item 3

Multi-level list:

# one
## aye
## bee
## see
# two
## x
## y
# three

Mixed list:

* Point one
* Point two
## Step 1
## Step 2
## Step 3
* Point three
** Sub point 1
** Sub point 2


h1. Hyperlinks

Well, that went well. How about we insert an <a href="/" title="watch out">old-fashioned hypertext link</a>? Will the quote marks in the tags get messed up? No!

"This is a link (optional title)":http://www.textism.com


h1. Images

!/common/textist.gif(optional alt text)!

Some more text of dubious character. Here is a noisome string of CAPITAL letters. Here is something we want to _emphasize_. 
That was a linebreak. And something to indicate *strength*. Of course I could use <em>my own HTML tags</em> if I <strong>felt</strong> like it.


h1. Coding

This <code>is some code, "isn't it"</code>. Watch those quote marks! Now for some preformatted text:

This isn't code.


So you see, my friends:
