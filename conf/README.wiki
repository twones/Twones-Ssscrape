== Manager ==

The [wiki:Design/Manager Ssscrape manager daemon] will use a simple, intuitive ini-style format configuration file containing:

 * Database configuration
 * Worker configuration (defaults and worker-specific)
 * Manager-specific configuration (poll timeouts, file paths, â€¦)

There are two configuration files:

 1. A default configuration file [source:trunk/manager/conf/default.conf conf/default.conf] with default settings that should not be changed.
 2. A local configuration file {{{conf/local.conf}}} to set installation-specific options and to override default values. Note that this local configuration file ''must not'' be placed under version control.


== Workers ==

Workers may implement their own configuration solutions. The [wiki:Design/Workers workers page] may contain more information about this.
